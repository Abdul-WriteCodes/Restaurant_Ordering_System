EFActor is a web-based AI-powered psychometric analysis platform designed for researchers, students, and data analysts working with survey and latent construct data. It removes the complexity of tools like R, SPSS, and Stata by providing a no-code, structured workflow for factor analysis

## Problem
Researchers face major friction when running factor analysis:
- ⚠️ High learning curve (R, SPSS syntax, SEM tools)
- ⚠️ Poor diagnostics for item-level issues
- ⚠️ Manual iteration (drop, rerun, repeat)
- 🚫 No built-in data repair mechanisms


## The Solution
EFActor provides a fully integrated psychometric analysis pipeline for users to:
- ✅️ Run and assess dataset fit for EFA
- 🔍 Run EFA analysis and diagnose EFA issues in a dataset (weak loaders, and cross loaders)
- ⚙️ Auto-fix engine for problematic variables
- ✅️ Model Confirmatory Factor Analysis
- 📥 Generate and export clean dataset generation
- Export-ready Word reports (.docx)

# Core Features
1. EFA (Exploratory Factor Analysis)
   - 📈 KMO & Bartlett’s Test
   - 📈 Eigenvalues + Scree Plot
   - 📐 Factor Loadings (Varimax rotation)
   - 📊 Communalities & Variance Explained

2. Smart Diagnostics that detect and flag:
   - Low communality
   - Cross-loading variables
   - Weak factor loadings
   - Severity scoring + drop recommendations

3. Auto-Fix Engine (Key Differentiator) that iteratively fixes:
   - Outliers (Winsorization)
   - Skewness (Log transforms)
   - Kurtosis
   - Collinearity (Jittering)
   - Zero-variance issues
   - Preserves statistical integrity while improving model quality

4. CFA that auto-build measurement model and Fit indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR) and evaluate model
5. Synthetic Data Generation that supports:
   - Factor-based generation
   - Correlation-based generation
   - Validation against original dataset

6. Interactive Visualizations
   - Scree plots
   - Factor loading heatmaps
   - Communality charts
   - Correlation matrices
   - Synthetic vs original comparisons
